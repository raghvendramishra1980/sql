# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Type 1 Architecture - Overwrite Changes: This table structure overwrites the existing address with the new one, so only the current address is stored. This is suitable for data where historical changes are not important.

Type 2 Architecture - Overwrite Changes: This table structure retains all historical addresses by adding a new record each time an address changes. Each record has start and end dates to track the period during which the address was valid.

Yes, there are privacy implications to consider when designing customer address tables, especially with regard to retaining historical data (Type 2 SCD) versus overwriting data (Type 1 SCD). While Type 1 SCD has fewer privacy implications due to its limited data retention, Type 2 SCD provides valuable historical insights at the cost of increased privacy risks. The choice should be guided by balancing business needs with privacy concerns, ensuring compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
First difference is the clasificaation of schema based on the business entity.
Tables also have the unique key defined.

Certainly, I can define a unique key in the EmployeeShift table on Employee_ID, Shift_date, and Shift_type to ensure that each employee can have only one shift on the same date.
